purpleair - collect Purple Air air quality data
Copyright 2018 - Kenneth Baker

purpleair is a weewx extension to collect data from the local
interface of a Purple Air air sensor (https://www.purpleair.com/). It
saves this data to its own database which can then be displayed in
weewx reports.


1) run the installer (from the git clone):
  wee_extension --install . 

2) restart weewx:

sudo /etc/init.d/weewx stop
sudo /etc/init.d/weewx start


This will install the purpleair.py extension into the weewx/user/
directory.  It will also add the necessary data bindings, hostname,
database, and service configuration to the weewx.conf configuration
file.

Something like the following:
  [PurpleAirMonitor]
    data_binding = purpleair_binding
    hostname = purple-air
  [DataBindings]
    [[purpleair_binding]]
        database = purpleair_sqlite
        manager = weewx.manager.DaySummaryManager
        table_name = archive
        schema = user.purpleair.schema

  [Databases]
    [[purpleair_sqlite]]
        database_name = purpleair.sdb
        driver = weedb.sqlite
